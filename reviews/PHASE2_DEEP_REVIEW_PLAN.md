# Phase 2 Deep Review Plan

## Goals
- Identify implementation risks, performance traps, and integration gaps across Phase 2 modules.
- Verify alignment with SensoryForge standards (docs, tests, type hints, units, APIs).
- Capture remediation steps without changing code.

## Scope
- CompositeGrid, solvers (Euler/Adaptive), equation DSL, extended stimuli.
- Current pipeline/YAML/GUI/CLI integration status and gaps.
- Test coverage, documentation coverage, packaging extras.

## Deliverable
- A detailed Markdown review with file/line references and recommended fixes.
