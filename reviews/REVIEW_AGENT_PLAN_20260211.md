# Review Plan

## Scope
- Full codebase review: sensoryforge/, tests/, docs/, docs_root/, reviews/

## Approach
1. Inventory modules, docs, and tests.
2. Prioritize critical components (core, filters, neurons, solvers, stimuli, gui).
3. Deep review each area for bugs, performance, scientific accuracy, API consistency, documentation gaps, and testing gaps.
4. Record actionable findings with exact file and line references.

## Deliverable
- reviews/REVIEW_AGENT_FINDINGS_20260211.md
