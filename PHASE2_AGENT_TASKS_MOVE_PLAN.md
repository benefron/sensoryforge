# Phase 2 Agent Tasks Relocation Plan

## Purpose
Move Phase 2 agent task files out of docs_root so remote agents can access them, then update internal links to the shared context file.

## Steps
1. Move the Phase 2 agent task folder from docs_root to the repository root.
2. Move the existing plan file into the same new folder.
3. Update task files to point to the new shared context path.
