# Decisions record — the reasoning behind the ledger

**Level 2 of three.** `docs_root/LEDGER.md` holds the *fact* of each decision (one line, generated from
the commit trailer). This file holds the *reasoning*: why, on what evidence, against what
alternative. Level 3 — a deck script, a paper, the README's claims — is whatever audience surface
this repo has, if it has one; `.claude/ledger.conf` names it under `AUDIENCE_SURFACE=`, and it is
updated on request, never automatically.

A decision recorded here but not in the ledger is invisible to future sessions. A decision in the
ledger but not here is a verdict with no argument behind it. Write both.

**This file is append-only, and it keeps its history.** Every section is dated. A decision that is
later superseded is **never deleted and never edited**: it gains a `**Superseded by:**` line, and
the section that replaces it opens with `**Supersedes:**`. The corrections are the record — tidying
them away is the exact failure this system exists to prevent.

**How to add one.** `ledger-sync.sh` has already appended the dated fact to the **log** at the
bottom for you. Write the reasoning as a section here, newest first, using this template:

```markdown
## D-0NN · <short title> · <YYYY-MM-DD>

**Supersedes:** D-0MM · <date>          <!-- omit unless it replaces an earlier decision -->

**What was decided.** <quote the ledger entry verbatim — level 1 and level 2 must agree>

**Why.** <the evidence: numbers, measurements, the `F-`/`D-` ids that forced it. Not "it seemed
cleaner" — what was observed.>

**What was rejected.** <the alternative that was seriously considered, and the specific reason it
lost. This is the half that stops the question being re-opened in three months.>

**Where it lives.** <file:line, config key, module — where a reader verifies the decision is real>

**Ledger id + sha.** D-0NN · `<short sha>`

**Validation pending.** <what would still falsify or confirm this, or "none — settled">
```

And on the section it replaces, add one line — nothing else changes:

```markdown
**Superseded by:** D-0NN · <date>
```

# Log — every recorded decision, in order

Appended automatically by `.claude/hooks/ledger-sync.sh` from `Decision:` and `Retires:` trailers,
so level 2 always holds at least the dated fact even before anyone writes the reasoning above.
Do not hand-edit between the markers.
