# SensoryForge Scope

**SensoryForge is an encoding-only playground.** It generates and explores sensory population responses to stimuli. Decoding and reconstruction are **not** in scope for this repository.

## In Scope (This Repo)

- **Grids** — Spatial substrates (standard, composite, Poisson, hexagonal)
- **Innervation** — Receptive field patterns (Gaussian, distance-weighted, sparse)
- **Filters** — Temporal dynamics (SA/RA, noise, custom)
- **Spiking models** — Izhikevich, AdEx, MQIF, FA, SA, Equation DSL
- **Stimuli** — Gaussian, textures, moving patterns, batch stimulus generation
- **Future extensions** — Spatial filters, composite grid integrations, intermediate layers

**Pipeline:** Stimulus → Grid → Innervation → Filters → Neurons → **Spikes / Population Activity**

## NOT In Scope (This Repo)

SensoryForge does **not** implement:

- **Decoding** — Mapping spikes back to stimulus
- **Reconstruction** — Recovering stimulus from neural activity
- **Bayesian estimators** — Kalman filters, particle filters, SSM
- **State-space models (SSM)** — For decoding/estimation
- **Analytical inverse** — Pseudoinverse, ridge decoders
- **STA (Spike-Triggered Average)** — Analysis/decoding methods

These belong to the **parent project** or downstream tooling, not SensoryForge.

## Documentation Context

`docs_root/STRATEGIC_ROADMAP.md` and `docs_root/SCIENTIFIC_HYPOTHESIS.md` describe the broader parent project. They may reference decoding, Kalman filters, and reconstruction — those are **parent-repo scope**, not SensoryForge.

When writing reports, docs, or rules for SensoryForge: describe it as an **encoding playground** that produces population activity (spikes, currents) from stimuli. Do not attribute decoding, reconstruction, or Bayesian estimation to this repo.
