# Phase 2 Agent Task Plan

## Purpose
Create parallel, digestible assignments for Phase 2 so multiple coding agents can work independently. Provide a shared reference file with only necessary, non-sensitive guidance from the development guide and copilot instructions, then create per-agent task files that reference that shared file.

## Steps
1. Create a dedicated folder for Phase 2 agent assignments.
2. Create a shared reference markdown file with Phase 2 goals, coding standards, and constraints (sanitized for non-sensitive content).
3. Create separate task files for each parallelizable Phase 2 deliverable (solvers, equation DSL, composite grid, extended stimuli), each with clear scope, inputs/outputs, tests, and boundaries.
